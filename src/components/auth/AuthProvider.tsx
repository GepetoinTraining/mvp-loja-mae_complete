// This is a placeholder AuthProvider.
// In a real NextAuth.js v5 setup, you might not need a traditional context provider
// as session data can be accessed via hooks like `useSession` or `auth()` from `next-auth` directly in components/pages,
// or passed down from Server Components to Client Components.

// If you were using a client-side session management approach or a different auth library,
// this is where you might wrap your application with a context provider.

// For NextAuth.js v5, the primary setup is in `src/lib/auth.ts` (for config) and
// potentially a `SessionProvider` from `next-auth/react` if you need to access session
// on the client side in older patterns, though the new model encourages server-side session handling.

// Since the build is looking for this specific path, we provide a basic component.
// It currently does nothing but render children. You might not even need this file
// if you adjust your `RootLayout` to not import it, depending on your NextAuth v5 strategy.

interface AuthProviderProps {

  // If you were using NextAuth.js v4/older client-side SessionProvider:
  // import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";
  // return <SessionProvider>{children}</SessionProvider>;

  // For NextAuth.js v5, often no explicit provider is needed here if using `auth()` server-side
  // or if your client components will use `useSession` (which requires <SessionProvider> from next-auth/react at the root).
  // However, if your RootLayout specifically imports this, we provide a pass-through.
